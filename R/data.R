#' Sample SIR data
#'
#' A small dataset containing points generated from a simple deterministic SIR model.
#' The model contains three input parameters, and generates three output
#' parameters. The initial populations are 950 susceptible (S), 50 infected (I),
#' and 0 recovered (R). The final values are taken at time t=10.
#'
#' The model operates using simple differential equations, where
#'
#' S' = aSR*R - aSI*S*I/(S+I+R)
#'
#' I' = aSI*S*I/(S+I+R) - aIR*I
#'
#' R' = aIR*I - aSR*R.
#'
#' @format A list of two data frames. The first has 30 rows and 6 variables, the second
#' 60 rows and 6 variables. The structure is the same in both cases:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{aSI}{Infection: transition rate from S to I}
#'   \item{aIR}{Recovery: transition rate from I to R}

#' Stochastic SIR Data
#'
#' An RData object consisting of two data.frames (in a similar fashion to \code{BirthDeath}).

#' in \code{GillespieSIR} (but with changed starting conditions) 100 times. The second has
