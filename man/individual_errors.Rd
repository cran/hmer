The relevant plot.

\description{
Plots the predictive error with respect to a variety of quantities.
}
\details{
The choice of errors to plot is controlled by \code{errtype}, and can be one
of four things: normal, corresponding to the regular standardised errors; eigen,
corresponding to the errors after reordering given by the eigendecomposition
of the emulator covariance matrix; chol, similarly deriving errors after Cholesky
decomposition; and cholpivot, deriving the errors after pivoted Cholesky decomposition.

What the errors are plotted with respect to is controlled by \code{xtype}. The options
are index, which plots them in their order in the validation set; em, which plots errors
with respect to the emulator prediction at that point; and any named parameter of the
model, which plots with respect to the values of that parameter.

Finally, the plot type is controlled by \code{plottype}: this can be one of normal,
which plots the errors; or qq, which produces a Q-Q plot of the errors.

The default output is to plot the standardised errors (with no decomposition)
against the ordering in the validation set; i.e. \code{errtype = "normal"},
\code{xtype = "index"}, \code{plottype = "normal"}.

Some combinations are not permitted, as the output would not be meaningful. Errors
arising from an eigendecomposition cannot be plotted against either emulator prediction
or a particular parameter (due to the transformation induced by the eigendecomposition);
Q-Q plots are not plotted for a non-decomposed set of errors, as the correlation
between errors makes it much harder to interpret.
