\title{Birth-Death Model Results}
\format{
A list of two data.frames \code{training} and \code{validation}: each
data.frame has the following columns:
\describe{
 \item{lambda}{Birth rate}
 \item{mu}{Death rate}
 \item{Y}{The number of people at time t = 15}
}
}
\usage{
BirthDeath
}
\description{
An RData object containing two data.frames. The first consists of ten parameter
sets run through a simple, two-parameter, stochastic birth-death model; five of the
points have 500 replicates and the other five have only 5 replicates. The second
consists of ten further points, each with ten replicates. The objects are denoted
\code{training} and \code{validation}, representing their expected usage.
}
\details{
The initial population for the simulations is 100 people; the model is run until
t = 15 to obtain the results to emulate.
